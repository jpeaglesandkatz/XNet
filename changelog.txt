- Kyle Edwards fixed various things related to the facades:
    - Fixed some rendering issues when breaking facades

    - Allow facade/cable rendering in all layers, ensuring that translucency works in addition to cutouts and solids.
    - Always render the cable even if there is also a facade, so that translucent and cutout blocks show the cable inside.

- Made compatible with the latest McJtyLib (3.0.0)
- New wireless router. A wireless router must be connected to a routing network (using the special routing cables) to a normal router. All published channels on that router will be made available remotely to another wireless router. Note that a wireless router needs an antenna to work
